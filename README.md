# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
This project is a console-based Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Java as part of the GeeksforGeeks Nation SkillUp Program. The game is designed for two players (X and O) who take turns to mark the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The game checks for a winner after every move and declares the result accordingly.
